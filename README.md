My Perl-Tools

Just 2c from me for the tools I use every day...

Perhaps you have to do this first:

```
sudo apt install libdbd-mysql-perl liblocale-gettext-perl libpoe-loop-tk-perl
```

## Getting started

Install all:

```
sh ./install.sh
```

Install translate:

```
cd translate
sh ./install.sh
cd ..
```

Install a2ps:

```
cd a2ps
sh ./install.sh
cd ..
```

Install myconf:

```
cd myconf
sh ./install.sh
cd ..
```

Install mycopy:

```
cd mycopy
sh ./install.sh
cd ..
```
